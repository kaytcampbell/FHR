              "We have used Full House Renovations now 3 times, first time was 15 years ago and then the last two
              years as well. Obviously since we have used them 3 times we have been extremely happy with their
              service. Quality has been great, tradesmen have been great and final product was amazing.
              I think people expect too much going into a renovation, quality takes time, and unforeseen things
              come up all the time as well. BUT in the end everything is beautiful. We were referred to them and I
              have also referred them now many times as well. If and when we are still here when it’s time to
              change again they will be our go to company for sure!!!!!"

              "I would highly recommend Full House Renovations Inc. They completed a main floor renovation in
              our home in March to July 2014 and we are very happy with the work that was done. The project
              involved removing walls and installing a new kitchen. I worked with the kitchen designer and
              everything turned out exactly as I wanted it. We lived in the basement during the renovation and the
              very first day of demo the crew removed our existing kitchen cabinets and installed some in the
              basement for us to use for our kitchen.
              We were very pleased with all of the Full House staff, on site and in the office. The workmanship on
              the cabinets is great and they even were able to make a custom TV cabinet to match. All of the
              trades and project manager were a pleasure to work with."

              "I have been using Full House Renovations the past 3 years for several projects ranging from developing
              our basement to replacing our windows with more work to come. I have found the staff from the
              tradesmen, the foremen to the office staff to be courteous and professional. The work performed
              either met or exceeded my expectations and any questions or concerns have always been dealt in a
              reasonable time.

            <p class="pb1">
              As for price, I have felt them to be reasonable too, neither too high nor are they the cheapest. Somewhere
              in the middle for midsize construction/renovation company that you expect to be around in the future
              if that is important to you as it is for me. I will continue to use Full House for future work and would
              recommend them."

              "(We can) hardly express how grateful we are for the work you have done for us, recently and in the

              In this most recent renovation you have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Replaced (our) carpet in the most professional way and in the process, repaired the terrible
              squeaking in the stairs and floors</li>
              <li>Repainted 75% of our home, ridding us of the ‘old fashioned’ look.</li>
              <li>The ceiling in the kitchen is flawless. The new lighting in the kitchen creates a warm and
              bright environment for our old eyes.</li>
              <li>The ladies and gentlemen in the office are endlessly patient and pleasant. No dreaded
              phone calls or confrontation and a few laughs</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pb1">
              Cooperation and a pleasant working environment much surely be two of the reasons for the success
              of your company. You are the benchmark which others can only hope to achieve. Small wonder you
              need not advertise. It is an accomplishment to be so professional while at the same time,
              maintaining a welcoming relationship with your clients."
